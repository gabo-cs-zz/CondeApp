      <p>
        Conde has a user profile for people with moneylender businesses or sales on credit. It's oriented to businesses of that type, which have
        multiple employees in charge of distributing products (cash or ware), and people who buy the products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conde saves the employees and customers information. It allows us to view the information from different clasifications. It allows a
        more optimal handling when it comes to needing records.
